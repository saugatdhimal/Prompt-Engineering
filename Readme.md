# Welcome to this course on ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers.
 
- A lot of that has been focused on the chatGPT web user interface, which many people are using to do specific and often one-off tasks. 

- But, the power of LLMs, large language models, as a developer tool, that is using API calls to LLMs to quickly build software applications is still very underappreciated.

- In this course, we'll share with you some of the possibilities for what you can do, as well as best practices for how you can do them. 

- First, you'll learn some prompting best practices for software development, then we'll cover some common use cases, summarizing, inferring, transforming, expanding, and then you'll build a chatbot using an LLM. We hope that this will spark your imagination about new applications that you can build. 

- In the development of large language models or LLMs, there have been broadly two types of LLMs, which I'm going to refer to as base LLMs and instruction-tuned LLMs. 

- Base LLM has been trained to predict the next word based on text training data, often trained on a large amount of data from the internet and other sources to figure out what's the next most likely word to follow. So, for example, if you were to prompt us once upon a time there was a unicorn, it may complete this, that is it may predict the next several words are that live in a magical forest with all unicorn friends. But if you were to prompt us with what is the capital of France, then based on what articles on the internet might have, it's quite possible that the base LLM will complete this with what is France's largest city, what is France's population and so on, because articles on the internet could quite plausibly be lists of quiz questions about the country of France. 

- Instruction-tuned LLM, which is where a lot of momentum of LLM research and practice has been going, an instruction-tuned LLM has been trained to follow instructions. So, if you were to ask it what is the capital of France, it's much more likely to output something like, the capital of France is Paris. So the way that instruction-tuned LLMs are typically trained is you start off with a base LLM that's been trained on a huge amount of text data and further train it, further fine-tune it with inputs and outputs that are instructions and good attempts to follow those instructions, and then often further refine using a technique called RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback, to make the system better able to be helpful and follow instructions. 

- Because instruction-tuned LLMs have been trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless, so for example, they are less likely to output problematic text such as toxic outputs compared to base LLM, a lot of the practical usage scenarios have been shifting toward instruction-tuned LLMs.Some of the best practices you find on the internet may be more suited for a base LLM, but for most practical applications today, we would recommend most people instead focus on instruction-tuned LLMs which are easier to use and also, because of the work of OpenAI and other LLM companies becoming safer and more aligned.

# Lesson 1 - Guidelines for Prompting
 In this lesson, you'll practice two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models.

## Setup
#### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.

In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.


```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

#### helper function
Throughout this course, we will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat). 

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs.  
**Note**: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.


```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

**Note:** This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version `0.27.0`. 

In order to use the OpenAI library version `1.0.0`, here is the code that you would use instead for the `get_completion` function:

```python
client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Prompting Principles
- **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
- **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

### Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`


```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
- JSON, HTML


```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied


```python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```


```python
text_2 = f"""
The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \ 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \ 
trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People \ 
are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. \ 
Some are having picnics, while others are playing \ 
games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a \ 
perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the \ 
beauty of nature.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_2}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 2:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting


```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think” 

#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task


```python
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.
"""
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)
```

#### Ask for output in a specified format


```python
prompt_2 = f"""
Your task is to perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by 
  <> with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the 
  following keys: french_summary, num_names.

Use the following format:
Text: <text to summarize>
Summary: <summary>
Translation: <summary translation>
Names: <list of names in summary>
Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <{text}>
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_2)
print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion


```python
prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
 help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \ 
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Note that the student's solution is actually not correct.
#### We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.


```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
```

```
Student's solution:
```

```
Actual solution:
```

```
Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \
just calculated:
```

#### Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom

To install the OpenAI Python library:
```
!pip install openai
```

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:
 ```
 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
 ```

Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
```

#### A note about the backslash
- In the course, we are using a backslash `\` to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
- GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not.  But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.

# Lesson 2 - Iterative Prompt Development
In this lesson, you'll iteratively analyze and refine your prompts to generate marketing copy from a product fact sheet.

## Setup

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```
```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

**Note**: In June 2023, OpenAI updated gpt-3.5-turbo. The results you see in the notebook may be slightly different than those in the video. Some of the prompts have also been slightly modified to product the desired results.
